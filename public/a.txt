AJAX is Asynchronus javascript and XML

- AJAX helps in fetching data Asynchronusly from a web server.
- Data loaded to AJAX call is done Asynchronusly without page refresh.
- Webserver will send response which contain data that we have requested.
- Data can be any format like JSON,XML...
- Servers used to send data in XML format.

In javascript we can call the AJAX by using "XMLHttpRequest" to exchange data from webserver.
- AJAX request can be send to server with 3 steps

1) Create XMLHttpRequest object.
ex - let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest()

2) Create request with that object by using OPEN() Method.
Syntax - xhr.open(method,url,Asynchronus,username,password)

ex - xhr.open('GET','a.txt','true')

3) Send a request using SEND() Method.
ex - xhr.send()

XMLHttpRequest - have 2 request they are
1) onprogress - it is used when request send to server & the request will back to webserver it will progress.
2)onload - this event will perform automatically when the response gives the data from server.
